# scene-composer
This project allows the user to draw scenes based on given images. The user has the choice to record a scene they are drawing, which will give them the option
of naming the scene and calling it again later.
The Drawable and Moveable classes were written and provided for this project by Ron Cytron. The images were also premade for this project.
The main code block written by me is inside the while loop and indicated by a comment.
